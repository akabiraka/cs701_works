There are five things here:
    1. cs701_presentation: presentation construction directory
    2. argo_jobs directory
    3. cs701_reort: report construction directory
    4. report.pdf
    5. Other codes, which are basically used for running seprate works. 

Other than that, most of the directories are just for input-output reader.
